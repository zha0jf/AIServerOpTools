# AIServerOpTools

## Project Introduction

This project is a collection of operation and maintenance tools for domestic AI servers, developed primarily using Python and Shell. These tools are designed to simplify daily O&M work for AI servers and improve operational efficiency.

## Tools

This project currently contains one tool:

1. **Server Information Collection Tool** (`tools/server_info_collect.sh`): A bash script that collects comprehensive server information including hardware (CPU, AI accelerator cards, memory, motherboard, BIOS, storage, network) and software (OS, compiler, AI libraries, Docker, tuned profiles, IOMMU/SMMU status) details. It generates a detailed report for AI server diagnostics and comparison.

## Installation and Usage
